# markov_chains_game
School project about a game using Markov chains

1st year group project at ENSIIE, Ã‰vry-Courcouronnes.
This project involved creating a game in C, using Markov chains and stochastic processes.
It was carried out in parallel with a mathematics-oriented project on Markov chains, cf markov_chains_modelling repository.

This project has been imported from my personal ENSIIE Gitlab account.
